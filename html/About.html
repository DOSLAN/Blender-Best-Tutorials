    <h3 style="text-align: center">About The Software <br> &ltBLENDER&gt</h3>
    <p>Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the showcase.</p>
    <p>Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience. To confirm specific compatibility, the list of supported platforms indicates those regularly tested by the development team.</p>
    <p>As a community-driven project under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the public is empowered to make small and large changes to the code base, which leads to new features, responsive bug fixes, and better usability. Blender has no price tag, but you can invest, participate, and help to advance a powerful collaborative tool: Blender is your own 3D software.</p>
    <p>More help is always welcome! From developing and improving Blender to writing documentation, etc, there are a number of different things you can do to get involved.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center">About Site</h3>
    <p>When I started learning Blender, I have jumped from tutorial to tutorial, and gleam what I could from each. Which tutorial is overwhelming for beginners, which tutorial contains useless things, which tutorial is can be finished in a day, and will show you how to make your first scene.</p>
    <p>And so I have created a site where I stored all best tutorials that I have ever seen</p>
